## Hi there 👋

The purpose of our interdisciplinary undergraduate academic journal is to inspire and cultivate a community of scholarly inquiry among students across diverse disciplines by publishing exceptional, student-submitted academic work. By offering a platform for young scholars to share their research, analysis, and insights, our journal aims to enrich the Minerva undergraduate academic experience and encourage a culture of intellectual curiosity and innovation.
